## Slimefun4 Module Calculator

At most 9 modules allowed.

### Multiplier formulas

Processing Speed: 1 + S - 0.25P

Energy Consumption (Machines):  (1 + 2\*S + 0.5\*P) \* (0.85^E)

Energy Production (Generator) : (1 + 0.5E) \* (0.9^S) \* (0.8^P)

Product Waste: (0.1S)\*(0.75^P)

Where S, P, and E are the number of Speed Productivity, Efficiency modules each. The number of modules for tiers is calcualted as 2^(tier - 1) e.g. A tier 2 module is the same as 2 tier 1s and a tier 3 module is the same as 4 tier 1 modules.
